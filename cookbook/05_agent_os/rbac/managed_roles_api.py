Scenario 2 of 2: NO login service - they want US to manage users and roles

(If roles are new to you, read managed_roles.py first.)

The two ways a company can run this:
  1. they already have a login service, we only enforce  -> idp_workos_auth0.py
  2. THIS FILE - no login service, we manage users + roles ourselves
(a mix is possible too: a custom AuthorizationProvider that uses the token's role
 if it carries one, and falls back to this store for users who don't.)

In this scenario the company has no WorkOS/Okta. Their own app logs people in and
issues them a token that just says who they are. Everything about permissions
lives with US: we hold the list of roles, who has which role, and we let admins
change it. (We are not doing the login itself - no passwords or MFA - just the
"what are you allowed to do" part, which is what they asked us to provide.)

So this file adds a small set of web endpoints (a REST API) for managing all of
that while the app runs: create a role, give it to someone, take it away - over
plain HTTP.

Two important things this shows:

1. Only admins can use these endpoints. If a normal user calls them they get
   BLOCKED, and someone with no login at all is bounced even harder. So the tool
   that hands out power is itself protected.

2. Every change is written to an audit log: a permanent, append-only record of
   who changed what and when (e.g. "alice gave bob the runner role"). This is the
   kind of trail a security/compliance review asks for. At the end the file prints
   that log so you can see it.

The endpoints all live under /authz, for example:
    GET    /authz/roles                  -> list the roles
    PUT    /authz/roles/{role}           -> set what a role can do
    POST   /authz/users/{who}/roles      -> give someone a role
    DELETE /authz/users/{who}/roles/{r}  -> take a role away

Run it:
    pip install "agno[roles]"
    python managed_roles_api.py
