Roles protecting real data - who can delete a chat session

(If roles are new to you, read managed_roles.py first.)

A "session" is one saved conversation with an agent. Deleting one throws away real
data, so not everyone should be allowed to. This file shows roles protecting an
actual operation, not a toy one.

Three jobs:
- support  -> can LOOK at sessions, nothing else
- operator -> can look, edit, and DELETE sessions
- admin    -> can do anything

We put two saved sessions in the database, then watch what each person is allowed
to do. The key moment: the support person tries to delete a session and gets
BLOCKED, while the operator deletes one for real and the count drops from 2 to 1.
That is the whole idea of authorization in one screen: the right people get
through, the wrong ones get stopped, before any data is touched.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[roles]"
    python managed_roles_sessions.py
