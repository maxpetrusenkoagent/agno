Managed Roles - controlling who can do what in AgentOS

New to this? Start with this file. "Authorization" just means deciding who is
allowed to do what. Two pieces make it work:

1. A token. When a user signs in they get a token: a small signed ID card they
   send with every request. It says who they are (e.g. "bob") and can't be faked.
2. Permissions. On the AgentOS side you decide what each person can do, like
   "can look at agents" or "can run the research agent".

Listing permissions per person gets messy fast, so we use ROLES: a named bundle
of permissions. You say once what a role can do ("a viewer can read"), then hand
people roles ("bob is a viewer"). Change the role and everyone with it changes too.

Permissions are written in a short code called a "scope":
- "agents:*:read"              -> can look at any agent
- "agents:research-agent:run"  -> can run the one agent called research-agent
- "agent_os:admin"             -> can do everything (a super-admin)

This file creates three roles and two people, then makes real requests and prints
ALLOWED or BLOCKED for each. It also shows the neat part: you can change someone's
role while the server is running and their very next request reflects it, with no
new login and no new token.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[roles]"
    python managed_roles.py
(no OpenAI key needed here - we are only checking who is allowed, not actually chatting)
