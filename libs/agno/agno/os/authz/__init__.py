"""Pluggable authorization providers for AgentOS.

The ``AuthorizationProvider`` interface is the seam between AgentOS's request
handling and the logic that decides "can this principal do this action on this
resource". The built-in :class:`ScopeAuthorizationProvider` implements the
existing JWT-scope RBAC with zero external dependencies, so the default
behaviour is unchanged.

Customers who need a richer model (relationship-based / ReBAC, attribute-based,
or an external engine such as Casbin, OpenFGA or Cerbos) implement the same
interface and pass it via ``AuthorizationConfig(authorization_provider=...)``.

This mirrors the provider pattern used elsewhere in the ecosystem
(e.g. ``check`` / ``require`` / ``filter_accessible``) so the swap is a config
change rather than a fork of the request pipeline.
