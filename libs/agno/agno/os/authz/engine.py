"""The pluggable policy engine behind managed roles — the swappable backend seam.

:class:`~agno.os.authz.role_store.ManagedRoleStore` is the agno-native product
surface (create roles, set scopes, assign, audit). The *engine* underneath —
which actually stores policy and answers "is this allowed?" — is a swappable
adapter behind this narrow port. Casbin is the default
(:class:`~agno.os.authz.casbin_engine.CasbinPolicyEngine`); swapping to another
backend (OpenFGA, SpiceDB, a SQL table) means implementing :class:`PolicyEngine`
and passing it as ``ManagedRoleStore(engine=...)`` — no change to the store's API,
the ``/authz`` router, the cookbooks, or anything SDK users see.

The port speaks only agno terms — roles, subjects, scope strings, allow/deny.
No engine types (Casbin enforcers, obj/act tuples, OpenFGA tuples) leak across it.
